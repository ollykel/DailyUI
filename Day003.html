			<p class="longForm">In 1998, nineteen-year-old Greg Sestero was yet another young man with the dream of making it to Hollywood. 
				During an acting class he noticed one of his classmates: a very strange man with an undefinable accent who 
				was clearly unsuited for acting yet didn't seem to be embarrassed by it. Very quickly, he found the man's 
				scenes to be both painful to watch yet highly entertaining. On a whim, Greg approached him and asked if he 
				wanted to do a scene with him. Though clearly taken aback at this spontaneous act of interaction, the man 
				agreed.
			</p>
			<p class="longForm">
				That man was one Thomas "Tommy" P. Wiseau, who avoided questions about his background. Little did Greg know 
				that Wiseau would change his life forever, especially when the latter began work on what he saw as his 
				magnum opus — a romantic drama called The Room... and boy was it a magnum opus for all the wrong reasons.
